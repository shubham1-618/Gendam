### **Consent-Based Attraction Protocol**
Before any charisma practice:
1. **Self-Consent Check:** "Do I have pure intention?"
2. **Environmental Consent:** "Is this space appropriate?"
3. **Target Consent:** "Am I respecting others' autonomy?"

### **Recognition Training Integration**
Use charisma training to recognize when others are using influence techniques on you:
- Practice awareness of your own reactions
- Notice when you feel unusually drawn to someone
- Identify patterns that feel manipulative

### **GLP Integration for Ethical Influence**

**Ethical Application:**
- Use rapport building for genuine connection
- Apply embedded commands only for positive influence
