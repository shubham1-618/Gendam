## Fundamental Energy Philosophy

### The Nature of Gendam
**Definition:** Gendam is not a process but an energy itself - a pure energy that can be programmed with imagination and feeling.

**Core Principle:** 
> "Gendam is like pure water - it has no taste, color, or properties of its own. But when you add something to it (imagination + feeling), it becomes whatever you program it to be."

### The Three Dantian System
**Lower Dantian (नाभि के नीचे):**
- Location: Below the navel
- Nature: Pure, unprogrammed energy
- Also called: Magnetic field
- Function: Source of raw power for manifestation

**Middle Dantian:**
- Function: Processing and transformation center
- Role: Bridges lower raw energy with upper spiritual centers

**Upper Dantian:**
- Function: Spiritual connection and higher consciousness
- Enhanced by: Sirat Dadi Sak Sirak mantra

### Energy Programming Formula
**Pure Energy + Imagination + Feeling = Programmed Energy**

This is the fundamental equation of Gendam work:
1. **Pure Energy:** Raw life force from lower dantian
2. **Imagination:** Mental visualization of desired outcome
3. **Feeling:** Emotional charge and conviction
4. **Result:** Specific energy that manifests the intended result
