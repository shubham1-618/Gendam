Gendam and magnetism have existed since ancient Javanese kingdoms, especially Mataram. Practiced by kings, warriors, and spiritualists for protection, influence, and healing.

## Mythological Roots and Royal Lineage
According to Javanese mythology, the origins of Gendam are linked to Dewi Kunthi and the royal lineage of Adji Saka. These stories describe the transmission of secret mantras and energetic techniques from the gods to the royal courts of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. The knowledge was guarded by palace spiritualists and only passed to trusted heirs.

## Evolution of Techniques
Over centuries, Gendam evolved from ritual-based practices—using mantras, gaze, touch, and voice—into more systematic methods. The four main technique categories are:
- **Gaze (Tatapan Magnetis):** Projecting energy and intent through the eyes.
- **Voice (Suwara):** Embedding mantras and commands in speech.
- **Touch (Cablek, Tepuk):** Transferring influence via handshake or pat.
- **Indirect Media:** Using objects, water, or written talismans as energy carriers.

## Ethics and Spiritual Context
Traditional Gendam emphasizes ethical use, spiritual grounding, and positive intent. Practitioners are taught to avoid harm, respect free will, and use their abilities for healing, protection, and the greater good. Many mantras invoke divine names (Asmaul Husna) and require ritual purification before use.

> **Tip:**
> Before practicing any Gendam technique, perform a cleansing ritual and set a clear, positive intention.

## Integration with Modern Practices
In the modern era, Gendam has blended with Western mesmerism, hypnosis, and bioenergy models. Contemporary teachers (e.g., Ryan Lee, Edi Sugianto) combine ancient Javanese methods with scientific understanding of brainwaves and energy projection. Online courses and global workshops now make these teachings accessible worldwide.

## Example Mantra (Ajian Gendam)
**Javanese (Romanized):**
> "Ya Gendam, Aku Berkuasa Atas Pikiranmu, Tunduklah Kepadaku!"

**Translation:**
> "O Gendam, I have power over your mind, submit to me!"

**Use Case:**
- Used in influence rituals, always with ethical intent and after purification.

**Practice Technique:**
1. Sit quietly and breathe deeply 7 times.
2. Visualize a golden light around your head and heart.
3. Recite the mantra 11x, focusing on your intention.
4. Project your intent through your gaze or voice.

> **Warning:**
> Never use this mantra for harm or manipulation. Energetic backlash and karmic consequences are believed to occur.
