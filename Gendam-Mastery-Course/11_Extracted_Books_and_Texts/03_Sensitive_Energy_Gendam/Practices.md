## Energy Sensitivity Training

### Practice 1: Palm Chakra Activation

**Preparation:**
- Sit in cross-legged position (bersila)
- Begin with prayer for divine protection and guidance
- Completely relax your entire body
- Gently shake both palms to make them loose and relaxed
- Maintain relaxed state - avoid forced concentration

**Step-by-Step Technique:**

**Phase 1 - Chakra Stimulation:**
1. Press right index finger into the center of left palm
2. Make slow rotating motions for 10-15 seconds
3. Feel the pressure and circular movement
4. Repeat: Press left index finger into center of right palm
5. Rotate for 10-15 seconds with gentle pressure

**Phase 2 - Energy Detection:**
1. Immediately open both palms after rotation
2. Position palms facing each other, about 6 inches apart
3. Hold this position calmly and relaxed
4. **Feel for sensations** emanating from palm centers (palm chakras)
5. Notice any subtle energy or warmth between palms

**Phase 3 - Aura Exploration:**
1. Slowly separate palms to full body width
2. Gradually bring palms back together very slowly
3. **Key Moment:** At some point, you'll feel palms touching an "invisible thin wall"
4. This is your aura fields meeting and creating resistance
5. Move palms about 5cm away from this "wall" position
6. Feel the pressure return between your palms

**Phase 4 - Energy Ball Formation:**
1. Bring palms closer to the resistance point
2. Feel as if you're touching a solid object
3. Sensation should be like holding a ball or large grapefruit
4. This pressure is created by your palm auras meeting
5. Experiment with moving palms closer and further apart

**Expected Sensations:**
- Pressure or resistance between palms
- Feeling of touching invisible solid object  
- Gentle flowing energy when auras penetrate each other
- Subtle current or fine vibrations
- Warmth, tingling, or pulsing sensations

**Important Notes:**
- Don't be discouraged if you feel nothing initially
- Less sensitivity doesn't mean lack of ability
- Everyone has energy and aura while alive
- Daily practice gradually develops sensitivity
- Reiki practitioners develop this faster through regular practice

### Practice 2: Finger Energy Projection

**Setup:**
- Position right index finger 2cm away from left palm
- Maintain comfortable, relaxed posture
- Focus intention on projecting energy from fingertip to palm

**Technique:**
1. **Energy Intention:** Clearly intend to project energy from fingertip to palm surface
2. **Writing Motion:** Move index finger as if writing on palm without touching
3. **Pattern Creation:** 
   - Write specific letters or words
   - Draw geometric shapes: triangles, squares, circles
   - Create flowing patterns or symbols
4. **Sensation Awareness:** Feel for subtle energy touching palm surface
5. **Practice Duration:** Continue for 5-10 minutes per session

**Expected Sensations:**
- Feeling like being gently blown by wind
- Warm or cool sensations on palm
- Tingling or flowing energy
- Subtle pressure or touch without physical contact

**Progression:**
- Start with simple shapes
- Advance to complex patterns
- Practice with both hands alternately

### Practice 3: Eye Gaze Energy Projection

**Basic Setup:**

**Technique:**
1. **Closed Eye Vision:** With eyes closed, direct attention toward palm position
2. **Energy Source:** Project energy from closed eyes OR from Ajna chakra (third eye)
3. **Laser Visualization:** Imagine powerful laser-like energy beams
4. **Mental Writing:** Move closed eyes as if writing/drawing on palm
5. **Sensation Awareness:** Feel energy sensations on palm surface

- **Combined Method:** Use both sources simultaneously

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Practice switching between eye energy and Ajna energy

## Sabda Gendam Training (Sacred Word Power)

### Object Command Practice

**Setup Requirements:**
- Choose practice object: empty water bottle, lighter, small box, etc.
- Place object 2-3 feet in front of you
- Ensure quiet, undisturbed environment

**Command Technique:**
1. **Focused Gaze:** Stare intensely at the chosen object
2. **Mental Command:** Give single-word commands silently in your heart
3. **Energy Projection:** Use any of the four energy projection methods

**Core Command Words (Sabda Inti):**
- **"JATUH"** - Fall/Drop

- **"BERHENTI"** - Stop

**Critical Rules:**
