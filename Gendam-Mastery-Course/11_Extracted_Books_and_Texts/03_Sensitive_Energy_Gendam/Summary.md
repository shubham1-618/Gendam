**Source:** NAQS DNA Online Course  
**Classification:** Practical Training Module - Energy Sensitivity Development

## Overview

This document represents Lesson 2 of Edi Sugianto's online Gendam course, focusing specifically on developing energy sensitivity and practical power transmission techniques. Unlike theoretical texts, this is a hands-on training manual designed for live online instruction.

## Core Teaching Philosophy

### Sacred Rules (Hukum Gendon)
1. **Knowledge Protection**: All teachings shared must remain within the authorized circle - spreading without permission is forbidden
2. **Pure Intention**: Only those with good intentions should study Gendam - those with evil intent must leave immediately
3. **Divine Connection**: This knowledge is only for beneficial purposes, connected to the Divine Energy System (Sistem Energi Ilahi NAQS DNA)
4. **Spiritual Consequences**: Violators will have their energy connection severed and be removed from the student registry

## The Four Pillars of Gendam Power

### 1. PRANA (Energy, Vibration & Resonance)
- The fundamental life force energy
- Vibrational frequency that creates resonance
- Primary power source for all Gendam techniques

### 2. CIPTA (Visualization)
- Mental imagery and creative visualization
- Ability to see and shape energy patterns
- Essential for directing power effectively

### 3. RASA (Emotion & Sensualization)
- Emotional connection and feeling states
- Sensory awareness and sensitivity development
- The bridge between mind and energy

### 4. KARSA (Sacred Words & Suggestion)
- Sabda Gendam (Sacred Gendam Words)
- Self-suggestion (Auto-suggestion)
- Hetero-suggestion (Influencing others)

## Primary Energy Source: Nur Alif

For this course level, students focus exclusively on **ASMAK NUR ALIF** as the primary energy source, except for non-Muslims who may use **Gendam Raja Harimau** if uncomfortable with Islamic terminology.

**Rationale:** Master Edi emphasizes learning one technique thoroughly rather than scattered learning - "If we study all energy techniques, when will you learn the technical aspects? We could spend a year just discussing energy alone."

## Practical Application Method

### Pre-Activation Protocol
**Before meeting target:**
1. Recite the Key Mantra once silently while holding breath
2. Stomp foot on floor once while exhaling
3. Alternative: Clap right palm on thigh while exhaling

**Key Mantra (Mantra Kunci):**
*"Bismillah, Nur Alif, Yo Nurullah, Manjing Saknjerone Jiwa ragaku"*
*(In the name of Allah, Light of Alif, O Light of Allah, Enter into the depths of my soul and body)*

### Active Application
**During use:**
1. Recite basic command mantras silently: "TIDUR" (Sleep), "MANUT" (Obey), "SEMBUH" (Heal), etc.
2. Hold breath while visualizing target already affected by Gendam energy
3. Channel energy through:
   - Touch (Sentuhan)
   - Breath/Blowing (Tiupan)
   - Eye gaze (Tatapan mata)

### Advanced Practice
In certain conditions, practice can be done without mantras, relying purely on the four pillars:
1. **PRANA & RASA** - Feel the energy consciousness
2. **NIAT** - Intention/Will (Karsa/Kehendak)
3. **CIPTA** - Visualization
4. **KARSA** - Command suggestion

## Energy Sensitivity Training Methods

### Method 1: Palm Energy Detection
**Setup:**
- Sit cross-legged, pray for divine protection and guidance
- Relax entire body, gently shake palms to make them loose
- Stay relaxed, avoid forced concentration

**Technique:**
1. Press right index finger into center of left palm, rotate for 10-15 seconds
2. Repeat with left index finger on right palm center
3. Open both palms facing each other
4. Hold position and feel energy emanating from palm centers (palm chakras)
5. Slowly separate palms to body width, then bring together slowly
6. Feel the "invisible thin wall" between palms
7. Move palms 5cm apart, feel pressure return
8. Experience the sensation like touching a solid ball or sweet grapefruit

**Expected Sensations:**
- Pressure between palms
- Feeling of touching invisible solid object
- Subtle energy flow when palms penetrate each other's aura
- Gentle current or fine vibration

### Method 2: Finger Energy Projection
**Setup:**
- Position index finger 2cm from palm
- Intend to project energy from fingertip to palm

**Technique:**
1. Move index finger as if writing on palm without touching
2. Write letters, draw shapes (triangles, squares, circles)
3. Feel subtle energy touching palm surface

**Expected Sensations:**
- Feeling like being blown by wind
- Hot or cold sensations
- Tingling or flowing sensations

### Method 3: Eye Gaze Energy
**Technique:**
1. Gaze at your palm
2. Intend to project energy from both eyes
3. Visualize laser-like energy beams from eyes
4. Move eyes as if writing/drawing on palm surface
5. Feel energy touching palm skin

### Method 4: Mental Energy Projection
**Setup:**
- Same position as Method 3 but with closed eyes
- Practice "looking" at palm with closed eyes

**Technique:**
1. With eyes closed, direct energy from eyes or Ajna chakra
2. Visualize laser-like energy projection
3. Move closed eyes as if writing/drawing on palms
4. Feel energy sensations on palm surface

## Sabda Gendam Training (Core Word Power)

### Object Practice
**Setup:**
- Place object in front of you (empty water bottle, lighter, etc.)
- Gaze sharply and focus on object
- Command object to move using single-word commands

**Commands (Sabda Inti/Core Words):**
- "JATUH" (Fall)
- "NGGULING" (Roll)
- "ROBOH" (Collapse)

**Rules:**
- Use only ONE WORD commands (not sentences)
- Speak commands silently in heart
- Avoid complex phrases like "O bottle, please roll over..."

**Expected Results:**
- Objects will NOT actually move (if they did, it would be frightening!)
- This trains the mental command structure
- Develops single-word power focus

### Living Target Practice
**Applications:**
- Command clouds to disperse
- Command chickens to be quiet
- Command cats to be still
- Any natural or animal targets

**Energy Transmission:**
- Use any of the four energy projection methods
- Can combine multiple methods simultaneously
- Integrate palm, finger, gaze, and mental projection

- Consistent daily practice more valuable than theoretical knowledge
- Practical application in daily life is the goal

## Spiritual Framework

### Divine Connection
- All practice begins with prayer for divine protection and guidance
- Connection to "Sistem Energi Ilahi NAQS DNA" (Divine Energy System)
- Islamic framework with universal energy principles
- Accommodation for non-Muslim practitioners

### Ethical Foundation
- Knowledge only for beneficial purposes
- Strict prohibition on harmful applications
- Master-student relationship with spiritual accountability
- Sacred trust in knowledge transmission

## Modern Applications

This training module bridges ancient Javanese energy work with modern understanding of:
- Biofield energy and human aura
- Psychosomatic influence and suggestion
- Meditation and mindfulness practices
- Energy healing modalities
- Hypnotic and therapeutic suggestion

The systematic approach to developing energy sensitivity provides a foundation for all advanced Gendam applications in healing, influence, and spiritual development.
