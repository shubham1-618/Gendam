**Original Title:** NGEMAT 1, SABDA PANDITA RATU  
**Module:** Module 6 - Online Gendam Training  
**Author:** Edi Sugianto (GUBES NAQS DNA)  
**Classification:** Advanced Emotional Bridging & Sacred Word Power  
**Focus:** Building Emotional Bridges and Mastering Irresistible Commands

## Overview

This module represents advanced training in the legendary "Sabda Pandita Ratu" technique - one of the most powerful forms of Gendam influence. The title translates to "Words of the Wise King" and refers to commands that cannot be refused or reversed. This training introduces the sophisticated "Ngemat" practice for building emotional bridges and achieving perfect rapport before influence.

## Core Philosophy: Sabdo Pandito Ratu, Tan Keno Wola Wali

**Sacred Principle:** "Sabdo Pandito Ratu, Tan Keno Wola Wali"  
**Translation:** "Words of the Wise King, Cannot Be Turned Back"  
**Meaning:** Gendam commands that are projected will definitely enter and influence the subject - they cannot be refused, rejected, or fail.

This represents the ultimate level of Gendam mastery where one's words carry the absolute authority of a king or ruler, making them irresistible and inevitable.

## The Foundation: Building Emotional Bridges

### Why Emotional Bridging is Essential
Before any hypnosis, Gendam, or hypnotherapy can be effective, practitioners must establish **Building Rapport** - creating intimacy and closeness with the target to generate trust. This requires **Kontak Batin** (Soul Contact) to build emotional bridges that create genuine sympathy, empathy, and sincere care, resulting in complete trust.

### Problems with Traditional Rapport Techniques
Most hypnosis and NLP rapport-building techniques are:
- Complicated and difficult to master
- Require high intelligence to execute properly
- Time-consuming and impractical for many situations

### The Ngemat Solution
Master Edi presents a simplified technique derived from ancestral wisdom of the Indonesian archipelago, adapted with modern Mind Technology principles for easy practical application.

## Ngemat: The Art of Replication

### Definition of Ngemat
**Ngemat** is the process of creating replication of excellence possessed by someone (yourself or others), so that this excellence can be used by yourself or others as needed.

This involves:
- **Energy Scanning** - Reading and feeling others' energy signatures
- **Frequency Matching** - Synchronizing with their emotional/energetic state
- **State Replication** - Copying and embodying their internal experience
- **State Transmission** - Projecting desired states back to them

## The Three-Stage Ngemat Process

### Stage 1: Energy Consciousness Access
**Purpose:** Develop sensitivity to surrounding energies  
**Method:** Relax and increase sensitivity to environmental energy (Scanning)  
**Goal:** Achieve heightened awareness of subtle energy fields

### Stage 2: Building Emotional Bridges
**Purpose:** Learn to recognize and read frequency signatures  
**Method:** "Feel what they feel" - Rasamu Rasaku (Your feeling is my feeling)  
**Process:** "Your feeling exists within my feeling, and I can feel what you feel"  
**Result:** Complete emotional synchronization and empathy

### Stage 3: Emotional State Transfer
**Purpose:** Project your desired state into their experience  
**Method:** "My feeling becomes your feeling" - Rasaku rasamu  
**Process:** "Now my feeling exists within your feeling"  
**Application:** "With Sabda Gendam, I change your feeling according to my will"

## Historical Context: Ancient Sacred Knowledge

## Practical Training System

### Lesson 1: Get Connected - Energy Scanning

**Objective:** Develop sensitivity to energy fields of objects and people

#### Scanning Practice 1: Object Energy Reading
**Method:**
1. Select 3 different objects in your environment
2. Extend palm toward each object
3. Intend to feel only with palm sensation
4. Intend to match frequency or harmonize with object's energy
5. Feel the energy with your palm
6. Observe and record sensations

**Reporting Format:**
- Object 1: [Name] - Sensation: [Description]
- Object 2: [Name] - Sensation: [Description]  
- Object 3: [Name] - Sensation: [Description]

#### Scanning Practice 2: Human Energy Reading
**Method:**
1. Direct palm toward a person nearby
2. Feel energy sensations in palm AND chest (emotional feelings)
3. If no person available, use visualization - imagine them present
4. Practice with minimum 3 people
5. Record both physical and emotional sensations

**Safety Protocol:**
If uncomfortable sensations arise:
1. Take deep breath and exhale forcefully
2. Intend to release all uncomfortable feelings
3. Continue until comfortable state returns

**Reporting Format:**
- Person 1: [Name] - Palm sensation: [Description] - Emotional feeling: [Description]
- Person 2: [Name] - Palm sensation: [Description] - Emotional feeling: [Description]
- Person 3: [Name] - Palm sensation: [Description] - Emotional feeling: [Description]

### Lesson 2: Sabda Gendam Level 2 - Change Feelings

**Objective:** Use Sabda Gendam to alter others' emotional states

#### Process:
1. **Assessment:** Among scanned subjects, identify who feels uncomfortable or unpleasant
2. **Energy Activation:** Read Kunci Nur Alif or perform Gendam Nur Alif meditation
3. **Sabda Projection:** Project appropriate Sabda Gendam to them

#### Command Examples:
- If they're anxious → Project: **"TENANG"** (Calm)
- If they're sad → Project: **"GEMBIRA"** (Happy)
- If all subjects feel fine → Project: **"DATANG"** (Come here)

#### Additional Sabda Commands:
- **NGANTUK** - Sleepy
- **TIDUR** - Sleep
- **GEMBIRA** - Happy
- **SENYUM** - Smile
- **SEMANGAT** - Energetic
- **LEMAH** - Weak

#### Practice Requirements:
- Minimum 3 days of practice
- Use various subjects and different Sabda commands
- Use nearby subjects for response monitoring
- Regular reporting for evaluation and consultation

### Advanced Application: Changing Taste Perception

**Key Understanding:** 
What changes is not the actual taste of food/drink/cigarettes, but the taste perception of the subject's sensory system.

#### Triple Suggestion Method:
Combine three types of suggestion simultaneously:
1. **Verbal Suggestion** - Spoken words
2. **Non-Verbal Suggestion** - Actions and demonstrations
3. **Energy Suggestion** - Sabda Gendam projection

#### Example Script:
1. **Setup:** "Do you believe this food's taste can change?"
2. **Permission:** "Want to try?" (Wait for agreement)
3. **Declaration:** "Okay, I'll change the taste to [specify taste]"
4. **Performance:** Perform Sabda Gendam with slight show/demonstration
5. **Testing:** "Try it now... slowly, savor it..."
6. **Reinforcement:** If subject isn't sensitive enough: "Try again... slowly... enjoy it..."

#### Self-Application:
For personal practice, directly project Sabda Gendam to the food/drink and test yourself.

## Key Success Factors

### 1. Scanning Mastery
Scanning serves as the foundation for building emotional bridges and creating frequency pathways for Sabda Gendam vibrations. Like Tai Chi, it uses the opponent's energy to defeat the opponent.

### 2. Subject Sensitivity
If a subject is not sensitive to energy, simply change to a different subject. Not everyone is equally receptive to Gendam influence.

### 3. Gradual Development
**Warning Against Rushing:** Like a weightlifter who attempts weights far beyond their capacity and suffers physical injury, Gendam students who rush beyond their level risk:
- Mental injury and trauma
- Loss of self-confidence
- Destruction of faith and belief
- Fatal consequences for development

### 4. Systematic Building
Even magnificent buildings are constructed brick by brick, wall by wall. Similarly, becoming a legendary Gendam Master requires:
- Patient, gradual training
- Step-by-step development
- Maximum and safe development of all mental muscles
- Willingness to follow systematic procedures

## Training Philosophy & Limitations

Written online classes have limitations compared to face-to-face workshops where direct interaction and monitoring are possible. Therefore:
- **Student Cooperation Required** - Follow all procedures patiently

### Progressive Mastery Approach
The training is designed like athletic development:
- **Foundation Building** - Establish basic capabilities
