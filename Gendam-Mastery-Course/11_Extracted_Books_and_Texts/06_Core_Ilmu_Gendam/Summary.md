## Gendam Mechanism Process

### Four Primary Trigger States

#### 1. Shock/Surprise (Terkejut/Kaget/Syock)
- **Method:** Creating sudden surprise without target's knowledge
- **Technique:** "Cablek" - surprise touch method
- **Effect:** Bypasses conscious defenses through unexpected contact
- **Application:** Instant influence through startled state

#### 2. Trust/Belief (Percaya)
- **Condition:** When target trusts and believes in practitioner
- **Opportunity:** Complete openness to influence and suggestion
- **Method:** Building credibility and rapport systematically
- **Result:** Target acts according to practitioner's desires

#### 3. Emotional Instability (Emosi Tidak Stabil)
- **States:** Anger, sadness, anxiety, worry, and emotional turbulence
- **Opportunity:** Optimal time for energetic influence
- **Method:** Energy vibration projection during vulnerable moments
- **Effectiveness:** Maximum receptivity during emotional disruption

#### 4. Wonder/Amazement (Kagum/Heran)
- **Condition:** When target is amazed, wondering, and impressed
- **Timing:** Perfect moment for influence projection
- **Method:** Creating awe and fascination systematically
- **Result:** Target follows practitioner's will during amazed state

### Simplified Influence Formula
**Create conditions where target becomes:** Focused, trusting, curious, amazed, wondering, startled, entranced, attracted, etc.

**Result:** Critical area becomes unguarded, allowing subconscious access for influence, healing, motivation, persuasion, teaching, and consciousness programming.

## Requirements & Restrictions

- **Protection:** Preventing defensive blocking by maintaining secrecy

### Critical Restrictions

#### 5. Humility & Respect
- **Avoid Arrogance:** Pride and showing off weakens energy vibration
- **Respectful Approach:** Maintain humble and respectful demeanor

## Key Difference: Hypnosis vs. Gendam

### Hypnosis Characteristics

### Gendam Characteristics

2. **Point Direction:** Focus energy toward chosen influence points on target
3. **State Programming:** Project specific states (weakness, confusion, sleepiness) through Gendam vibration
4. **Response Monitoring:** Observe target reactions (must remain unaware of process)

**Critical Key:** Experience the desired state within yourself first, then project that feeling to the target.

### Specific Programming Formulas

**Application:** Speak this sentence with concentration and full conviction.

#### Direct Voice Programming
**Formula:** "When I say your name [target's name], then submit and obey all my commands."

#### Telephone Voice Programming
**Formula:** "Say [target's name]... when you hear my voice, then you will obey and submit to all my commands."
