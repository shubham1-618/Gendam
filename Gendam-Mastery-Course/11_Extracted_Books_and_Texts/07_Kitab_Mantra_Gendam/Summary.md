## Core Philosophy

### The Nature of Mantras
Mantras (or Affirmations/Ruqyah in Arabic) are sequences of suggestive sentences designed to awaken specific powers, whether sourced from within or outside oneself. For Muslims, reading mantras is not considered shirk (polytheism) if the wording doesn't contradict Islamic monotheistic beliefs.

### The Hakikat (Essence) of Ijazah
The tradition of spiritual authorization (ijazah) works like providing startup capital for a business. A teacher who has accumulated sufficient spiritual energy can transmit this power to students, allowing them to begin practice from an elevated starting point rather than from zero. This creates an energy pattern with specific frequencies that shapes the student's development according to the teacher's lineage.

## Level System & Energy Hierarchy

### NAQS DNA Approach
Unlike traditional schools with multiple expensive levels, NAQS DNA uses:
- **Single/Dual Mantras:** Core formulas remain consistent
- **Group Meditation (Tawajjuh):** Level advancement through collective practice
- **Divine Energy Source:** Unlimited potential through spiritual connection
- **Vibrational Hierarchy:** Higher/finer vibrations control lower ones

### The Four Pillars of Gendam Power
1. **PRANA:** Energy, vibration, and resonance
2. **CIPTA:** Visualization and mental imagery
3. **RASA:** Emotion and sensory experience
4. **KARSA:** Command suggestion and will power

## Key Principles

### Energy Follows Mind
Energy follows belief and conviction in the subconscious mind. When the heart is certain, energy flows fully. When doubtful or half-hearted, energy becomes weakened or self-destructive through internal conflict.

### The Importance of Conviction (KEYAKINAN)
Complete acceptance and unwavering belief in an idea without any questioning. Examples include believing the earth is round, trusting a friend's goodness, or having confidence in one's abilities.

### Wadah & Isi (Container & Content)
Meditation sensations occur due to adaptation between the incoming spiritual power and one's existing energy system. Different people experience different sensations based on their energy level, system cleanliness, life problems, and aspirations.
