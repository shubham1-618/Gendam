## The Three Core Elements

### 1. Communication
- Foundation for all human relationships
- Verbal and non-verbal interaction skills
- Persuasive communication techniques
- Building rapport and trust

### 2. Energy Vibration
- Every human possesses internal energy and vibration
- Personal electromagnetic field and aura
- Vibrational frequency matching and resonance
- Energy projection and transmission abilities

### 3. Intention/Mantra/Prayer
- Focused will and clear purpose
- Sacred formulas and power words
- Prayer and spiritual invocation
- Manifestation of desires through directed intention

## Psychological Mechanisms of Gendam

### Optimal Influence States
**1. Shock/Surprise (Cablek Technique)**
- Create sudden surprise without target's awareness
- Bypass critical thinking through unexpected events
- Momentary disorientation allows influence access

**2. Trust and Belief**
- When target trusts and believes in you
- Opportunity to guide and influence behavior
- Foundation for all persuasive interaction

**3. Emotional Instability**
- Anger, sadness, anxiety, worry states
- Unstable emotions create vulnerability
- Prime opportunity for energy vibration influence

**4. Wonder and Admiration**
- When target is amazed and impressed
- Curiosity and fascination lower defenses
- Enhanced receptivity to suggestions

### Influence Strategy
**Create conditions where target becomes:**
- Focused, trusting, curious
- Amazed, surprised, captivated, attracted

**Result:** Critical thinking becomes relaxed, allowing subconscious access for:
- Influence and persuasion
- Healing and therapy
- Motivation and inspiration
- Seduction and attraction
- Education and learning
- Belief modification

## Requirements & Restrictions

### Essential Requirements
1. **Knowledge Mastery** - Complete understanding of techniques and theory
2. **Energy Power** - Developed vibrational abilities through practice
3. **Self-Confidence** - Absolute belief in your own capabilities
4. **Physical/Psychological Stability** - Balanced and calm internal state
   - Avoid practice when tired, sleepy, stressed, or emotional

### Critical Restrictions
4. **Secrecy** - Never reveal your Gendam abilities to targets
5. **Humility** - Avoid arrogance and showing off (weakens energy)
6. **Selective Use** - Apply only when necessary, not for trivial matters

### Difference from Hypnosis
**Hypnosis:** Requires agreement and cooperation from subject
**Gendam:** Must NOT involve agreement - if target knows or challenges you, they can block the influence

## Energy Development Ritual

### Phase 1: Awakening (Pembangkitan)
**Position:** Cross-legged (yoga position), eyes closed, tongue curved to roof of mouth

**Technique:**
1. Become aware of each breath in and out
2. Breathe calmly and peacefully
3. Unite with your breath rhythm
4. Become one with your breathing (breath awareness)
5. Continue for approximately 5 minutes
6. Proceed immediately to strengthening phase

### Phase 2: Energy Strengthening (Penguatan)
**Position:** Cross-legged, hands in mudra position (thumbs inside closed fists)
**Setup:** Eyes closed, tongue tip curved to roof of mouth

**Technique:**
1. Maintain breath awareness with calm and peace
2. Feel the silence within yourself
3. Focus on "Tantien Point" below the navel
4. **Breathing Mantra:**
   - Inhaling: Silently say "SOOOOO...."
   - Exhaling: Say with vibration "HMMMMM...."
5. Continue without time limits - practice with calm, relaxed, sincere attitude
6. **Advanced Focus:** Shift attention from Tantien (below navel) to Ajna (between eyebrows)
7. **Result:** Divine light/illumination/chakra activation will appear

**Purpose:** This ritual serves as daily energy charging for Gendam vibration
**Requirement:** Must be performed daily to maintain and increase vibrational power

## Five Energy Transmission Channels

### 1. Palm/Hand Contact
- **Methods:** Handshakes, touching, Cablek technique
- **Application:** Direct physical contact transmission
- **Effectiveness:** High due to direct energy transfer

### 2. Eye Gaze
- **Method:** Direct eye contact or visual focus
- **Application:** While target looks at you or you focus on them
- **Range:** Line of sight influence
- **Technique:** Project energy through visual connection

### 3. Mental/Thought Projection
- **Method:** Pure mental influence (telepathy-like)
- **Application:** Long-distance influence without physical presence
- **Requirement:** Strong visualization and mental focus
- **Range:** Unlimited distance with proper technique

### 4. Voice/Sound
- **Methods:** Direct conversation or telephone communication
- **Application:** While target hears your voice
- **Effectiveness:** Works through any audio medium
- **Technique:** Embed energy vibration in vocal transmission

### 5. Aura/Charisma
- **Method:** Personal presence and energetic field
- **Application:** Influence one or multiple people simultaneously
- **Range:** Anyone who can see or sense your presence
- **Effect:** Automatic influence through personal magnetism

**Implementation:** Can use single channel or combine multiple channels for enhanced effect

## Nine Influence Points on Human Body

### Target Areas for Energy Direction
1. **Crown Chakra** - Top of head (Ubun-ubun)
2. **Ajna Chakra** - Between eyebrows (Third eye)
3. **Temples** - Left and right sides
4. **Neck/Nape** - Back of neck
5. **Shoulders** - Left and right
6. **Arms** - Either left or right
7. **Heart Chakra** - Front and back
8. **Palms** - Hand centers
9. **Knees** - Left and right

**Application:** Direct energy to one or multiple points depending on desired effect and target receptivity

## Practical Application Techniques

### Basic Programming Method
1. **Channel Selection:** Use one or combination of five energy channels
2. **Target Point:** Direct energy to appropriate influence points on target
3. **Programming:** Send vibration with intention to make target "weak, confused, or sleepy"
4. **Observation:** Watch target's reaction (they must not know what's happening)

**Key Principle:** "If you program 'weakness,' first feel weakness in yourself, then transmit that feeling to your target"

### Specific Programming Formulas

#### Eye Gaze Programming
```
"When [target's name] looks into my eyes, then [state your intention],
then visualize like a bridge connecting as a wave of energy
carrying your message and intention to their mind.
(Repeat intention in heart with full conviction)"
```

#### Mental/Telepathy Programming
```
"To influence objects from distance using telepathy technique.
Key: You must be able to clearly and vividly imagine the target's form,
then include emotions/feelings representing your will"

Examples:
"[Name], you want to follow my invitation"
"Nabila, you will feel longing and love for me"
```

#### Handshake Programming
```
"When I shake their hand, their anger will melt away
or they will submit to me"
```
*Recite with concentration and full conviction*

#### Direct Voice Programming
```
"When I call your name [name], then submit and obey
all my commands"
```

#### Telephone Programming
```
"[Name], when you hear my voice,
you will comply and submit to all my commands"
```

#### Aura/Charisma Programming
```
"When you/anyone sees me, submit and
be influenced by me"
```

**Training Philosophy:** "Position yourself as an empty vessel capable of receiving knowledge - accept first what is taught, don't analyze or conclude prematurely. Use your right brain (imagination, emotion, feeling, faith) and avoid left brain analysis during training."

**Daily Practice:** The energy development ritual must be performed daily to maintain and increase Gendam vibrational power - this is non-negotiable for serious practitioners.
