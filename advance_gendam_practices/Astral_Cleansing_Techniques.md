## Philosophy

In Javanese mysticism, **Pembersihan Gaib** (unseen cleansing) is a crucial practice for maintaining spiritual and energetic hygiene. It is understood that spaces, objects, and even people can accumulate negative energy (**energi negatif**), residual emotional imprints (**jejak emosional**), or become home to unwanted spiritual entities (**penghuni gaib**).

The Gendam approach to space clearing, known as **Ruwatan**, is a holistic ritual designed to:
- **Neutralize Negative Energy**: Dispel stagnant or harmful vibrations.
- **Banish Unwanted Entities**: Politely ask or forcefully remove spirits that cause harm.
- **Break Curses & Spells**: Dismantle active magical attacks (**santet** or **teluh**).
- **Restore Harmony**: Re-establish a balanced and positive energetic environment.
- **Install Protection**: Create spiritual shields (**pagar gaib**) to prevent future issues.

This practice is not merely about "getting rid of bad vibes" but is a sacred act of restoring cosmic order (**memulihkan keseimbangan alam**) within a specific location.

## Step-by-Step Practice: The Ruwatan Ritual

### Phase 1: Assessment & Diagnosis (Pemeriksaan)
1.  **Initial Walkthrough**: Walk the property to sense energy with your hands and body. Use a pendulum or dowsing rods to map out hot spots.
2.  **Clairvoyant Scan**: Enter a meditative state and use your third eye to see the energetic state of the house and any entities present.
3.  **Spirit Communication**: Respectfully open a dialogue with the resident spirits. Ask why they are there. Are they guardians, lost souls, or malicious entities?
4.  **Formulate a Plan**: Based on the diagnosis, decide the course of action. Will you be negotiating with spirits, performing a gentle cleansing, or conducting a full-scale exorcism?

### Phase 2: Preparation of the Space (Persiapan Tempat)
1.  **Physical Cleaning**: The space must be physically cleaned first. Remove all clutter, dust, and dirt.
2.  **Open All Doors & Windows**: Create a path for negative energy to exit.
3.  **Set up a Central Altar**: Place a white cloth with candles, incense, holy water, salt, and flowers in the center of the property.
4.  **Create Protection Circle**: Cast a circle of protection around the property and a personal one for yourself and any assistants.

### Phase 3: The Cleansing Ritual (Ritual Pembersihan)
1.  **Invocation (Pembukaan)**: At the central altar, invoke God, archangels, guardian spirits, and masters of the Gendam lineage for protection and assistance. State the intention of the ritual clearly.
2.  **Systematic Clearing**: Start from the back of the house and move towards the front door. Go room by room.
    - **Sprinkle Holy Water & Salt**: Flick blessed water and salt into all corners of each room, chanting a cleansing mantra.
    - **Smudging**: Use a thick smoke from your incense blend to purify every inch of the space, from floor to ceiling.
    - **Sound Vibration**: Clap loudly, ring bells, or use a singing bowl to break up stagnant energy.
3.  **Entity Negotiation & Removal**:
    - **For Lost Souls**: Create a portal of light and guide them towards it with compassion.
    - **For Negative Entities**: Use commanding mantras and the power of your Keris to forcefully banish them. Address them by name if known.
    - **For Curses**: Visualize the curse as a dark web or cord. Use your Keris to cut it and see it dissolve into light.
4.  **The Final Push**: Herd all remaining negative energy towards the main entrance. Stand at the door and perform a final, powerful banishing command, visualizing all negativity being pushed out and away from the property forever.

### Phase 4: Sealing & Protection (Penyegelan & Pagar Gaib)
1.  **Closing the Exits**: Once the space is clear, close all windows and doors.
2.  **Sealing**: Go to each window, door, and mirror. Draw a protective symbol (e.g., a pentagram or a specific Javanese sigil) with blessed oil or your finger, visualizing it sealing the portal with divine light.
3.  **Creating the Energetic Fence (Pagar Gaib)**:
    - Walk the perimeter of the property, inside or out.
    - Plant the yellow bamboo stakes at the four corners.
    - Visualize a powerful wall of light connecting the stakes, extending deep into the earth and high into the sky.
    - Recite a powerful protection mantra continuously as you do this.
4.  **Blessing the Space**: Return to the central altar. Fill the now-cleansed space with positive energy, love, and light. State the new "rules" of the house, declaring it a sanctuary of peace.
5.  **Closing Ritual**: Thank all the divine beings and spirits who assisted. Formally close the ritual and dismantle the protection circle.

## Mantra

### Primary Cleansing Mantra
```
Original Javanese:
"Bismillahir rahmanir rahim.
Sun matek ajiku, ajiku si ruwat sejati.
Resik-resik kabeh energi reged,
Metu kabeh roh jahat, jin lan setan.
Omah iki dadi suci, padhang, lan tentrem.
Kersaning Gusti Allah. La ilaha illallah."

English Translation:
"In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
I invoke my sacred power, the power of true purification.
Cleanse, cleanse all impure energy.
Exit, all evil spirits, jinn, and demons.
This house becomes holy, bright, and peaceful.
By the will of God Almighty. There is no god but God."
```

### Protection Fence Mantra (Mantra Pagar Gaib)
```
Original Javanese:
"Ya Allah, Ya Hafizh, Ya Muhaimin.
Pagerana omah iki nganggo pager wesi,
Pager geni, pager banyu, lan pager angin.
Saka kabeh arah, ora ana sing bisa nembus.
Slamet, slamet, slamet."

English Translation:
"O Allah, O The Preserver, O The Guardian.
Fence this house with a fence of iron,
A fence of fire, a fence of water, and a fence of wind.
From all directions, nothing can penetrate.
Safe, safe, safe."
```

## Visualization Techniques

- **Vortex of Light**: Visualize a powerful whirlwind of white and golden light descending from the heavens into the center of the property. See it spinning faster and faster, sucking up all darkness, negativity, and unwanted entities and transmuting them in the light.
- **Spiritual Weeding**: See negative energies and entities as dark weeds in a garden. Visualize yourself pulling them out by the roots and casting them into a sacred fire to be purified.
- **The Dome of Protection**: After cleansing, visualize a brilliant, impenetrable dome of golden or blue light forming over the entire property, shielding it from all external negative influences.

## Connections to Other Practices

Energetic Space Clearing is a practical application of many Gendam powers, requiring a versatile and skilled practitioner.

- **[Remote Viewing](./Remote_Vision_Clairvoyance.md)** & **[Clairaudience](./Clairaudience_Inner_Hearing.md)**: Before entering a space, a practitioner uses these skills to diagnose the problem from a safe distance. They are essential for identifying the types of entities and energies present.
- **[Spirit Communication](./Spirit_Communication_and_Taming.md)**: This is the first tool used in any cleansing. The practitioner must attempt to negotiate with resident spirits, as peaceful resolution is always preferred over forceful removal.
- **[Spirit-based Healing & Exorcism](./Spirit_Based_Healing_and_Exorcism.md)**: If the negative energy in a space is caused by a curse or a particularly malevolent entity attached to a person residing there, the clearing may escalate into a full exorcism.
- **[Kundalini Awakening](./Kundalini_Energy_Practices.md)**: The immense power of the Naga Api is the ultimate weapon for cleansing. Projecting this sacred fire can purify a space of even the most resilient negativity.
- **[The Forbidden Arts](./assassin.md)**: Understanding how curses and psychic attacks are constructed is necessary to deconstruct and neutralize them effectively during a cleansing.

This practice is a real-world test of a practitioner's mastery over foundational Gendam principles:
- **[Rituals and Ceremonies](../../09_rituals_and_ceremonies/cleansing.md)**: The Ruwatan is one of the most important ceremonies in Gendam.
- **[Protection Mantras](../../05_mantras/protection_defense_mantras.md)**: A practitioner is at their most vulnerable during a cleansing, making powerful protection mantras an absolute necessity.

## Risks and Warnings

- **Entity Retaliation**: Angered spirits may attack the practitioner during or after the ritual. Strong personal protection is non-negotiable.
- **Energy Transference**: Without proper shielding, the practitioner can absorb the negative energy or attachments from the space.
- **Incomplete Cleansing**: If the root cause (e.g., a cursed object) is not found and removed, the negativity will return.
- **Psychological Strain**: These rituals can be emotionally and mentally draining. Proper self-care after the event is crucial.
- **Making it Worse**: An inexperienced practitioner can agitate spirits and make the situation more volatile and dangerous.

## Source or Lineage Reference

- **Kejawen Traditions**: The core practices are deeply rooted in pre-Islamic Javanese animism and mysticism.
- **Ilmu Hikmah**: Islamic-influenced esoteric sciences provide many of the mantras and protective prayers.
- **Primbon Jawa**: Ancient Javanese texts contain various formulas and auspicious timings for Ruwatan rituals.
- **Lineage**: These techniques are typically passed down directly from a **Guru** to a student who has proven their spiritual maturity and strength. Key figures in this area include masters known for their **kesaktian** (spiritual power) in dealing with the unseen world.
