# Energy-Based Assassination (Ilmu Pamungkas & Serangan Gaib)
*Advanced Gendam Practice - The Ultimate Forbidden Arts*

> **DISCLAIMER & ABSOLUTE WARNING:** The contents of this chapter are documented for anthropological and preservation purposes ONLY. The practice of these techniques is considered the gravest violation of spiritual law. It brings catastrophic karmic consequences, eternal damnation, and unimaginable suffering to the practitioner and their lineage for generations. **DO NOT ATTEMPT. DO NOT PRACTICE. DO NOT EVEN CONTEMPLATE USING THIS KNOWLEDGE.** This is the path of darkness from which there is no return.

## Philosophy: The Path of Ruin

In the deepest and most secret corners of Javanese mysticism lies the **Ilmu Pamungkas** (The Ultimate or Final Science), which includes techniques for causing harm or death through purely energetic or spiritual means (**Serangan Gaib** - Unseen Attack). This is not considered a branch of Gendam to be studied, but a corruption and a perversion of its sacred principles.

While Gendam focuses on harmony, influence, and healing, these forbidden arts twist its methods for destruction. The philosophy here is not one of balance, but of absolute domination and annihilation. Practitioners of this dark path (**dukun santet**) are universally feared and reviled, believed to have sold their souls for temporal power.

The core principle is that concentrated, malevolent intent (**niat ala**), when focused and amplified by **Tenaga Dalam** and channeled through specific mantras and rituals, can be projected to disrupt another person's life force, causing illness, madness, or death.

## Methods of Unseen Attack (Serangan Gaib)

These methods are documented to educate on what to protect against, not how to perform them.

1.  **Santet**: The most well-known form. It often involves using physical objects (**media**) like nails, broken glass, or hair from the victim. The practitioner energizes these objects with negative intent and teleports them into the victim's body.
2.  **Teluh / Tenung**: A more direct psychic attack. It does not require physical media. The practitioner sends a "bolt" of destructive energy, often visualized as a ball of fire or a sharp object, to strike the victim's aura or vital organs.
3.  **Gendam Asmorodono (Corrupted)**: Twisting the Gendam of love and influence into an obsession that drives the target to madness or suicide if their affection is not returned or is manipulated for ruin.
4.  **Spirit Assassins (Khodam Suruhan)**: Binding a powerful, often demonic, entity to a contract to harass, torment, and eventually kill a target. This is considered one of the most heinous acts, as it enslaves a spirit to perform evil.
5.  **Draining Life Force (Nyedot Energi Urip)**: A form of psychic vampirism where the practitioner systematically drains the victim's vital energy over time, leading to a slow, wasting death that often appears as a mysterious illness to modern medicine.

## Signs of a Victim of Unseen Attack

The symptoms are often what spiritual healers look for when diagnosing a case.
- **Sudden, Unexplained Illness**: Medical doctors can find no cause for the rapid decline in health.
- **Localized, Sharp Pains**: Victims often feel sharp, stabbing pains, as if being pierced, which corresponds to the entry points of **santet**.
- **Vomiting Strange Objects**: In extreme cases of **santet**, victims have been known to vomit nails, pins, or other objects that were sent to them.
- **Severe Psychological Distress**: Extreme paranoia, hearing voices commanding self-harm, seeing terrifying apparitions, and a complete personality change.
- **Business or Family Collapse**: The attack is often aimed not just at the person, but at their entire life, causing businesses to fail, families to break apart, and complete social ruin.

## Required Preparations (For Historical Context Only)

The preparations for such a dark ritual are a desecration of sacred practice.
- **Pact with Lower Beings**: The practitioner often makes a pact with demonic entities, offering their soul or the souls of their descendants in exchange for power.
- **Isolation & Austerity**: They undergo extreme fasting and isolation, not for purification, but to build a cold, detached, and powerful will.
- **Desecration of Sacred Objects**: Using holy items in perverse ways to mock divine law and draw power from the inversion.
- **Graveyard Rituals**: Performing rituals at midnight in graveyards, using soil or body parts to anchor the spell.
- **Personal Effects of Victim**: Obtaining hair, nails, photos, or clothing of the target to create a strong energetic link.

## Step-by-Step Practice (A Descent into Darkness - FORBIDDEN)

This is a generalized sequence of a destructive ritual, documented for understanding the process of black magic, not for replication.

1.  **The Invocation of Darkness**: The practitioner calls upon dark forces, offering them incense, blood (often animal, sometimes their own), and promises.
2.  **Creating the Link**: The practitioner focuses intensely on the victim's personal effects, using them to build an unbreakable energetic bridge to the target.
3.  **Charging the Intent**: They enter a state of pure, cold hatred. All their will, energy, and the power granted by their dark patrons are focused into a single point of malevolent intent.
4.  **The Mantra of Cursing**: A specific, often guttural and terrifying, mantra is chanted repeatedly. These are not mantras of light, but chains of sound designed to bind, constrict, and destroy.
5.  **The Projection**: The charged energy is released.
    - In **Santet**, it is projected into the physical media, which then dematerializes and reappears inside the victim.
    - In **Teluh**, it is projected as a direct psychic missile aimed at the victim's third eye, heart, or solar plexus.
6.  **The Sealing of the Curse**: The practitioner performs a final ritual to "seal" the curse, making it difficult to detect and remove, and often setting up spiritual "traps" for any healer who might try to intervene.

## Mantra: The Words of Damnation

The true mantras for these practices are closely guarded secrets, and to even speak them is said to invite darkness. They are not listed here for any reason. Their nature is a perversion of divine names and words of power, twisted to serve ego and destruction. They are the antithesis of sacred sound.

An example of a *type* of phrase used might be:
`"Atas nama kegelapan, hancurlah engkau (nama korban), badanmu, jiwamu, rejekimu. Terkunci, terkunci, terkunci."`
`"In the name of darkness, be destroyed (victim's name), your body, your soul, your fortune. Locked, locked, locked."`

**To repeat: DO NOT RECITE. The vibration alone is a contamination.**

## Visualization Techniques: The Theater of Hate

The visualizations used are the opposite of healing techniques.
- **The Effigy**: The practitioner creates a mental or physical doll of the victim and visualizes stabbing, burning, or dismembering it, believing the harm will transfer.
- **The Constricting Serpent**: Visualizing a black serpent of energy wrapping around the victim, crushing their life force and suffocating their spirit.
- **The Black Sun**: Imagining a black, light-devouring sun in place of the victim's heart or head, extinguishing their inner light and vitality.

## Energy Exercises: The Perversion of Power

The energy work is a corruption of sacred Tenaga Dalam.
- **Nafas Racun (Poison Breath)**: Instead of drawing in pure energy, the practitioner visualizes inhaling all the poison, hatred, and filth of the world, concentrating it in their Dan Tian.
- **Gerak Mematikan (Killing Movement)**: The movements are not flowing and harmonious, but sharp, stabbing, and angular, designed to focus and project destructive force.
- **The Death Blow**: A technique where all of the body's energy is gathered and then projected in a single, explosive burst through the hands or eyes, aimed at shattering the victim's aura.

## The Perversion of Sacred Arts

The forbidden arts of unseen attack are a complete corruption of the sacred Gendam practices. Knowledge of the light is twisted to serve the darkness.

- **[Third Eye Activation](./Third_Eye_Activation.md)**: The Mata Batin, meant for divine sight, is used to spy on victims, identify their weaknesses, and precisely aim curses.
- **[Remote Viewing](./Remote_Vision_Clairvoyance.md)**: Used not for understanding, but for reconnaissance to plan a spiritual attack.
- **[Spirit Communication](./Spirit_Communication_and_Taming.md)**: Instead of respectful dialogue, the practitioner enslaves or makes pacts with malevolent entities to use as spiritual weapons.
- **[Object Sealing & Khodam Binding](./Object_Sealing_and_Khodam_Binding.md)**: The sacred art of creating a spiritual companion is perverted to trap a spirit and force it to carry out attacks, as seen in the creation of **santet** media.
- **[Kundalini Awakening](./Kundalini_Energy_Practices.md)**: The practitioner awakens the Naga Api not for enlightenment, but to fuel their attacks with an immense and destructive power.

The only legitimate reason for a true Gendam practitioner to study these methods is to understand how to defend against them and how to dismantle their effects, as is done in:
- **[Spirit-based Healing & Exorcism](./Spirit_Based_Healing_and_Exorcism.md)**
- **[Energetic Space Clearing](./Astral_Cleansing_Techniques.md)**

## RISKS AND WARNINGS: The Inevitable Price

This section is the most important part of this document.

### ðŸš¨ The Karmic Debt
The Law of Karma is absolute. For every ounce of suffering inflicted, the practitioner will receive it back, multiplied. This is not a risk; it is a certainty. The debt is paid through:
- **A life of misery**: Despite any temporary power, their life will be filled with paranoia, fear, and suffering.
- **A horrific death**: They often die in agony, tormented by the very spirits they commanded.
- **An eternity in lower realms**: Their soul is dragged to the darkest astral planes, where they endure torment for eons.
- **Generational Curses**: The karmic debt is so immense it passes to their children and their children's children, who will suffer from unexplained illness, bad luck, and misery.

### ðŸš¨ Spiritual Retaliation
- **Attack from the Victim's Guardians**: Every person has guardian spirits. Attacking someone means you declare war on their spiritual protectors, who are often far more powerful than the practitioner.
- **Betrayal by Dark Forces**: The demonic entities they serve are not loyal. They will eventually turn on the practitioner, draining them of their life and soul once they are no longer useful.
- **Divine Retribution**: The practitioner becomes an enemy of the divine order. Forces of light will actively work to neutralize them.

### ðŸš¨ Psychological Collapse
The constant immersion in hatred and darkness inevitably leads to madness. The practitioner becomes a hollow shell, consumed by the very forces they sought to command.

## Source or Lineage Reference: The Shadow Lineage

There is no respected "lineage" for these arts. There are only lines of master-student relationships built on fear, greed, and secrecy. They are often referred to as **"Ilmu Hitam"** (Black Magic) and are practiced by isolated individuals or small, hidden cabals. The knowledge is a scar on the spiritual history of humanity, a cautionary tale of the ego's ultimate corruption.

> **Final Word:** The only reason to know of this path is to recognize its signs and seek protection from it. To walk this path is to choose eternal self-destruction. The true power of Gendam and Kejawen lies in healing, harmony, and enlightenment. Choose the light. Always.
