Thank you for sharing this file. It’s a scholarly paper titled:

“Mantra in the Javanese Tradition as a Manifestation of Approach to God”
Based on the Primbon or testament of R.T. Puspanagara, a royal spiritual figure from Surakarta.

⚡ Your Request:
You said:

“This file has 12 mantras but it's Islamic. I don't like these mantras. Create a complete course ritual as per this PDF.”

✅ Understood. You want a practical, complete Ilmu Gendam/Kejawen training course, based on this manuscript, but not Islamized — instead, based on original Javanese metaphysics, energy, tirakat, etc.

🔥 Here's What I'll Do for You:
I will now extract the 12 mantras and their laku (rituals) and reconstruct them in the pre-Islamic Javanese energetic framework — rooted in:

Chakra-energy systems (Javanese: cakra kawuryan)

Breath and body discipline (napas, semedi, tapa)

Tirakat fasting (mutih, ngrowot, etc.)

Offerings (sajen, selametan) rooted in Kejawen cosmology

Gendam & Energetic Magnetism approach

Avoiding Arabic or Islamic elements

🔮 12-Part Course Plan: "Javanese Ilmu Gendam Codex of R.T. Puspanagara"
Module	Original Mantra Purpose	New Focus (Kejawen-Gendam)
1. Pangupa Jiwa	For Business Success	Energetic Business Magnetism: Empower your aura for wealth
2. Mantra for Charisma	To Be Loved and Respected	Ajian Semar Mesem + Heart Energy Expansion
3. Protection from Evil	Shield from Bad Energy	Ajian Kalacakra Protection + Hand Seal + Aura Cloaking

5. Pangirupiksa	To Manifest Goals	Focused Will Manifestation + 7-Day Meditation + Offerings

11. Bandung Karosan	Physical Strength	Internal Martial Cultivation + Bone Charging Spell
12. Braja Lamatan	Spiritual Armor	Activation of Body's Inner Fire + Vajra Light Defense System

🧭 HOW THE COURSE WORKS
Each module will have:

Mantra (rapal) – rewritten in Javanese or energetic poetic code.

Tirakat / Laku – specific fasting, cleansing, or training to empower the mantra.

Sajen / Offering Ritual – to balance the forces (kiblat papat lima pancer).

Energy Practice – breathwork, hand seal (mudra), visualization, or meditation.

Notes – explanation of metaphysical effect.

📥 NEXT STEP:
Would you like me to begin writing Module 1: Pangupa Jiwa (Energetic Business Magnetism) first?

Or do you want me to deliver all 12 modules in a codex format (like a PDF/course syllabus)?
Let me know your preference — and whether you'd like it:

in English, Javanese, or bilingual

with or without audio mantras

formatted as book, cheat sheet, or course PDF

🔥 This is going to be a true Ilmu Gendam Master Codex rooted in ancient Java — no Islamic overlay, pure energetic wisdom.

Charisma

Healing

Aura amplification

Magnetic Gendam presence

This module is essential for those walking the path of ajian, seduction, or spiritual power.

Your “Jati Diri” becomes fully awake.

📜 12.2 MANTRA (Ajian Jati Diri Pamungkas Rapal)
This is the “Crowning Mantra” — not for requesting power, but for declaring who you are:

“Ingsun iki dudu jenengku,
Ingsun iki dudu ragaku,

Dadi rasa, dadi cahya, dadi panguripan
Dadi sabda kang ora owah,
Dadi têkad kang tan kendhat

Then burn the paper and place ashes in water. Drink a sip as final act of inner sovereignty.

🌀 12.5 ENERGY PRACTICE (Mantra Integration Breath – Napas Nyawiji)
This breath crystallizes your Gendam field into an immortal, unified light-body.

Inhale and hold your breath

Sira kang ana ing aku
Wis bali, wis nyawiji,
Aku ora kudu ngundang, merga aku wis dadi panggonane kawaskitan iku.
