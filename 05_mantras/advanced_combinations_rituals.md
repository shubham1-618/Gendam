- Progress to heart-opening mantras (middle vibration)
- Culminate with spiritual mantras (higher vibration)
- Creates upward energy spiral

**2. Elemental Balance Pattern**
- Earth mantras for stability
- Water mantras for flow
- Fire mantras for transformation
- Air mantras for movement
- Space mantras for consciousness
