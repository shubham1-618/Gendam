## Introduction to Integrated Practice {#introduction}

The true power of Javanese Gendam mantras emerges when combined with complementary practices. This guide provides comprehensive instructions for integrating mantras with:

- **Tenaga Dalam** (Inner Power cultivation)
- **Mudras** (Sacred hand positions)
- **Visualization** (Mental imagery and energy direction)
- **Pranayama** (Breath control)
- **Chakra activation** (Energy center work)

### Core Philosophy

In Javanese tradition, the human being consists of multiple layers:
- **Raga** (Physical body)
- **Jiwa** (Soul/consciousness)
- **Roh** (Spirit)
- **Tenaga** (Life force energy)

Integrated practice harmonizes all these aspects for maximum effectiveness.

## Fundamental Principles {#principles}

### 1. The Three Pillars of Practice

- Alignment with ethical principles (not for harm)
- Connection to higher spiritual goals

#### C. Energy Direction (Arah Tenaga)
- Conscious guidance of life force through the body
- Coordination with breath and mantra rhythm
- Visualization of energy pathways

### 2. The Five Elements Integration

Each practice session should balance the five elements:

| Element | Sanskrit | Javanese | Energy Quality | Practice Focus |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Earth | Prithvi | Lemah | Stability, grounding | Foundation mantras, root chakra |
| Water | Apas | Banyu | Flow, emotion | Healing mantras, sacral chakra |
| Fire | Tejas | Geni | Transformation, power | Protection mantras, solar plexus |
