**Book Title:** *Menguak Fakta Gendam dengan Rasional - Kitab Covert Hypnosis Untuk Pemula*  
**Author:** Xsa Profesor Gendam (Tresa Saeputra)  
**Year:** 2008-2012  
**System:** GLP (Gendam Linguistic Programming)  
**Classification:** Modern Scientific Approach - Green Level (Safe for Beginners)

## Overview

This groundbreaking work presents Gendam as a rational, scientific discipline rather than mystical practice. Tresa Saeputra, drawing from his journey through traditional kebatinan, NLP, and international hypnosis training, developed GLP (Gendam Linguistic Programming) - a comprehensive system that demystifies Gendam through modern psychological principles.

## Core Philosophy

### Rational Gendam Approach
- **Rejects mysticism**: No mantras, jinns, or supernatural elements
- **Scientific foundation**: Based on psychology, NLP, biology, and chemistry
- **Practical application**: Focuses on real-world scenarios and protection
- **Ethical framework**: Emphasizes responsible use and defense against misuse

### Four Pillars of GLP
1. **Gendam Communication** - Verbal and non-verbal influence patterns
2. **Gendam Energy Quantum** - Energy manipulation without mysticism
3. **Gendam Technology** - Modern tools and techniques
4. **Gendam Biology & Chemistry** - Physiological aspects of influence

## Key Definitions

**Gendam**: The ability to influence others through subtle hypnotic techniques (verbal/non-verbal) without their awareness, making targets believe they're acting on their own will.

**Covert Conversational Hypnosis**: Hidden conversation patterns that bypass critical thinking factors through embedded commands and questions.

**GLP (Gendam Linguistic Programming)**: Structured approach using language patterns to influence subjects' subconscious programming.

## Historical Context

### Western Recognition
- Known as "Covert Hypnosis" or "Black Ops Hypnosis"
- Used in lobbying, negotiation, sales, therapy
- Milton H. Erickson pioneered conversational hypnosis techniques

### Indonesian Stigma
- Traditionally associated with crime and mysticism
- Rejected by mainstream hypnosis organizations
- GLP aims to rehabilitate Gendam's reputation as legitimate psychological discipline

## System Components

### 1. Communication Patterns
- **Embedded Commands**: Hidden instructions within normal conversation
- **Confusion Techniques**: Creating temporary mental disorientation
- **Overload Messages**: Overwhelming conscious mind with information
- **Misdirection**: Redirecting attention from actual influence attempts

### 2. Energy Manipulation (Non-Mystical)
- **Quantum Energy**: Scientific approach to bio-energy fields
- **Eye Contact Techniques**: Specific gaze patterns for influence
- **Aura Protection**: Defensive energy shielding methods

### 3. Chemical Applications
- **Kecubung (Datura)**: Traditional plant used in "sirep" techniques
- **Warning**: Dangerous and illegal - provided for recognition only
- **Safety protocols**: How to identify and protect against chemical Gendam

### 4. Psychological Techniques
- **Rapport Building**: Creating unconscious connection
- **Shock Induction**: Using surprise to bypass critical thinking
- **Mind Projection**: Visualization techniques for influence

## Practical Applications

### Defense Against Gendam
- Recognizing influence attempts in public spaces
- Protective mental techniques
- Identifying chemical Gendam (sirep) attempts
- Building mental resistance

### Legitimate Uses
- Sales and marketing influence
- Therapeutic applications
- Negotiation enhancement
- Personal development

## Training Structure

### Beginner Level
- Basic confusion techniques
- Simple embedded commands
- Rapport building exercises
- Protection methods

### Advanced Level (GLP Training)
- Complex pattern integration
- Multi-person operations
- Chemical and biological aspects
- Master-level applications

## Safety Warnings

### Red Lines
- Never use for criminal purposes
- Always obtain consent for practice
- Avoid dangerous chemical methods
- Maintain ethical boundaries

### Legal Considerations
- GLP techniques must comply with local laws
- Training requires proper certification
- Misuse carries legal consequences
- Professional responsibility emphasized

## Integration with Traditional Systems

While GLP presents a modern approach, it acknowledges traditional Gendam concepts:
- **Cablek**: Physical touch techniques reinterpreted psychologically
- **Sirep**: Chemical influence methods exposed for defensive purposes
- **Sabda**: Power of words understood through NLP principles

## Future Development

### Planned Publications
- **The Structure of Gendam Volume 1** (2013)
- **The Structure of Gendam Volume 2** (In development)
- Comprehensive GLP training curriculum

### Training Programs
- Official GLP certification courses
- International expansion planned
- Integration with existing psychological training

## Conclusion

GLP represents the evolution of Gendam from mystical tradition to scientific discipline. By removing supernatural elements and focusing on psychological principles, Tresa Saeputra has created a system that makes Gendam accessible to modern practitioners while maintaining its effectiveness. The emphasis on ethics, safety, and legitimate applications positions GLP as the future of Indonesian influence psychology.

This work serves as both introduction and warning - teaching the techniques while emphasizing the responsibility that comes with such knowledge. The ultimate goal is not just mastery of influence, but understanding how to protect oneself and others from its misuse.
