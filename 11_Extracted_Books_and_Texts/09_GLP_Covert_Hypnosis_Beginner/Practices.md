# GLP Covert Hypnosis - Practical Training Guide

**Level:** Beginner to Intermediate  
**System:** GLP (Gendam Linguistic Programming)  
**Safety Rating:** Green (Safe for practice with consent)

## Foundation Training

### Understanding the GLP Framework
GLP operates on four interconnected levels:
1. **Linguistic** - Language patterns and embedded commands
2. **Psychological** - Mental state manipulation
3. **Physiological** - Body language and energy projection
4. **Chemical** - Environmental and biological factors (theoretical knowledge only)

### Core Principles for Beginners

#### 1. The Critical Factor Bypass
**Concept:** Every person has a "critical factor" - the mental gatekeeper that evaluates incoming information. GLP techniques work by temporarily bypassing this filter.

**Practice Exercise:**
- With a willing partner, practice creating confusion through unexpected statements
- Example: "I saw your name fall on the street yesterday"
- Observe their reaction and the momentary confusion

#### 2. Embedded Commands
**Structure:** Hide commands within normal conversation using tonal emphasis and pausing.

**Basic Pattern:**
```
"You might [COMMAND] find yourself [DESIRED ACTION] feeling more relaxed now."
```

**Practice Examples:**
- "You can **close your eyes** when you're ready to relax"
- "It's interesting how people **give me their full attention** when I speak"
- "Some people **feel compelled to agree** with logical statements"

#### 3. Confusion Techniques
**Purpose:** Create temporary mental disorientation to open the subconscious.

**Beginner Exercises:**

**Exercise A: The Name Drop**
```
"Hey, I saw someone who looked exactly like you at the mall yesterday... 
but then I remembered you were here, so it couldn't have been you... 
unless you have a twin I don't know about?"
```

**Exercise B: The Contradiction**
```
"You know what's funny? The more you try not to think about something, 
the more you think about it... but when you try to think about it, 
you can't... it's like your mind has a mind of its own."
```

### Progressive Training Sequence

#### Week 1: Basic Rapport Building
**Daily Practice (15 minutes):**
1. **Mirror Exercise**: Match your partner's breathing, posture, and speech patterns
2. **Pacing Statements**: Make 3 observations about their current experience
3. **Leading**: After 5 minutes of pacing, gently guide them to a new topic or posture

**Example Script:**
```
"I notice you're sitting comfortably... and I can see you're breathing 
steadily... and as you listen to my voice, you might find yourself 
becoming more curious about what I'm saying..."
```

#### Week 2: Embedded Commands
**Daily Practice (20 minutes):**
1. **Command Insertion**: Practice hiding commands in normal conversation
2. **Tonal Marking**: Use subtle voice changes to emphasize commands
3. **Testing**: See if your partner unconsciously follows embedded suggestions

**Practice Commands:**
- "You might **feel comfortable** sharing your thoughts"
- "Some people **find themselves nodding** when they agree"
- "It's natural to **lean forward** when interested"

#### Week 3: Confusion and Overload
**Daily Practice (25 minutes):**
1. **Overload Messages**: Ask multiple questions rapidly
2. **Confusion Stories**: Tell stories with unexpected twists
3. **Shock Induction**: Use surprising statements to create momentary confusion

**Confusion Story Template:**
```
"Let me tell you about something strange that happened... 
I was walking down the street, thinking about how sometimes 
we walk without thinking, and then I realized I was thinking 
about walking while walking, which made me stop walking... 
and then I forgot what I was thinking about... have you ever 
had that happen?"
```

### Advanced Beginner Techniques

#### The GLP Pattern Stack
**Sequence for Influence:**
1. **Rapport** (30 seconds)
2. **Pacing** (2-3 statements)
3. **Confusion** (1-2 sentences)
4. **Embedded Command** (hidden in resolution)
5. **Future Pace** (suggest continuation)

**Complete Example:**
```
"I can see you're comfortable there... [RAPPORT]
and I notice you're listening carefully... [PACING]
You know, it's funny how sometimes we think we're making 
decisions, but really we're just following patterns we don't 
even realize we have... [CONFUSION]
...and as you consider that, you might find yourself 
wanting to learn more about this... [EMBEDDED COMMAND]
...and tomorrow, when you think back on this conversation, 
you'll realize how much sense it all makes... [FUTURE PACE]"
```

### Safety Protocols

#### Consent Requirements
- Always practice with willing participants
- Explain you're practicing communication techniques
- Stop immediately if anyone shows discomfort
- Never use for manipulation or deception

#### Warning Signs to Stop
- Subject appears distressed or confused
- Physical signs of discomfort (fidgeting, looking away)
- Verbal resistance or questioning
- Any indication of distress

#### Ethical Guidelines
- Use only for positive influence
- Respect personal boundaries
- Never use for financial gain without consent
- Always prioritize the subject's wellbeing

### Real-World Applications

#### Sales Context
**Pattern:**
```
"I can see you're considering this option... [PACING]
and many people find that when they really think about it... [SOCIAL PROOF]
the benefits become clear... [EMBEDDED COMMAND]
and they decide to move forward... [CLOSE]"
```

#### Social Context
**Pattern:**
```
"You seem like someone who enjoys learning new things... [PACING]
and it's interesting how we naturally gravitate toward 
people who share our interests... [CONFUSION]
so you might find yourself wanting to exchange contact 
information... [EMBEDDED COMMAND]"
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### "It's Not Working"
**Solutions:**
- Slow down your delivery
- Ensure proper rapport before attempting influence
- Practice tonal marking more subtly
- Check for resistance in your subject

#### "People Notice What I'm Doing"
**Solutions:**
- Make patterns more conversational
- Reduce obvious tonal changes
- Focus on natural delivery
- Practice with recordings to improve subtlety
